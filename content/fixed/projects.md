One of the main reasons that pushed me to do a entire blog remake is to add more tutorials and how-to's to it.
The way a sysadmin works nowadays is totally different from what it was just a couple of years ago, needless to say, it has changed 100% of what it was just 9-10 years ago.
During the last [FSL](https://fsl.mx/2016/) I gave a [talk](https://fsl.mx/2016/programa) titled "From hardware to the cloud, the evolution of a sysadmin).

So, my intention is to add a list of tutorials, how-to's and documentation on how to use the latest technologies used by SysAdmins, DevOps and SRE's.


### Configuration management 

* Puppet
* Chef
* Ansible

### Logging tools

* Grep, Awk (the old way)
* Logstash
* Elasticsearch
* Kibana
* Graphite and Collectd

### Programming and scripting

So, keep an eye on updates on this page.

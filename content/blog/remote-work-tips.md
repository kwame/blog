I've been working remotely for the last 8 years on a full time basis plus another 3-4 years partly remote. I've been fortunate that the companies that I've worked for have caught the vision of remote work and have acknowledged the fact that being able to see your employee sitting on a chair on a desk in the same office where the rest of the team works does not mean that this will convert you on a more productive resource. 

Being able to work remotely has a lot of perks, from my point of view, one of the biggest  +1 is that you can avoid the daily morning commute to the office. Driving in traffic, taking the bus or train on a daily basis will definitively wear you down and will have a negative impact on your daily performance. 
There are many other advantages of working remotely but I will not list them in here, I've rather write about what are some of the drawbacks of working remotely for a long period and how can you make your day to day tasks easier to complete.

If you've worked remotely for at least 6 months by now you know that there is a good ammount of situations that you need to avoid in order to have a productive day. 
Starting your day at a set time, not working in your pyjamas, having a separate place in your house that can be used a an office, respecting your work schedule can be some of the items that you know that are neccessary to keep a good and sane working environment.

### Establish a work schedule
When you work remotely, it is very easy to get relaxed about time limits and boundaries. If you don't establish a schedule, you will find yourself working from really early in the day or really late at night. The recommendation is to set a start of day, some time for small breaks and define a time when you will end your work day. By doing this you will be able to perform other activities every day. 

### Figure out your work style 
Some people need the background noise of a coffee shop and some people prefer to have absolute silence. One of the perks of remote work is that you can manage your work environment. So either you spend some time working in a place where there is people comming in and out or if you prefer to work on a total silent place, you can make this happen. 

### Reduce distractions
If you are having a hard time staying on a task and completing it, it may be related to distractors you have in your workflow.
I've found that having a lot of communication tools, sometimes what it does is that it takes your focus out of your current task. This will be worst if you have enabled some desktop notifications 

### Communication channels 
Communications with your team is essential when you are working remotely. Remember that your team is not seeing you in real time, so they are not aware if you are performing the tasks assigned to you or not. Setting clear expectations on derivable items and goals (daily, weekly, monthly) will alleviate stress on the team since everybody will know about the tasks status. 

### Tooling
Investigate about job requirements. Are you going to attend regular meetings? Will you need to conduct KT sessions? Based on the requirements, you will need to get a good headset, big monitor or a set of 2 monitors, a good quality webcam. Don't hesitate on purchasing tools that will allow you to perform your work in an optimal manner. 

### Make an investment in your home office 
Since you will spend a large ammount of time in your office, your desk and chair are essential for your day to day comfort. Besides those items, look for options on how can you  enhance your home office so you can enjoy your day at work.

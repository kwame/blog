Lately I've been spending quite a bit of time doing some Pythong programing and learning some new tricks and skills with it. I am in no way a software developer or software engineer, but I would like to be more fluent when writing Python scripts. 
I've been thinking about how to brush up my skills and how to present them in a more effective and organized way. 
I'll share more information in the next blog post.

🗣️ **Let’s talk about respect, experience, and the frustrating ritual of job negotiations.**

I’ve been in the IT industry for over **23 years**. So when a recruiter calls and immediately dives into a checklist of technologies asking,  
*“Have you worked with X?”*  
*“What about Y?”*  
*“Why isn’t Z on your resume?”*  
I can’t help but feel frustrated.

📄 Here's the reality: If I listed every single technology, tool, or platform I’ve worked with over the past two decades, my CV would be 10 pages long — and no one would want to read it. A resume is meant to be a snapshot of relevant, recent, and focused experience. It’s not a timeline of everything I’ve ever touched.

But here’s what really stings:  
After all those questions, the **first real concern** becomes:  
💸 *“What’s your hourly rate?”*  
And then — almost always — comes the follow-up:  
*“Is that open to negotiation?”*

Let me be very clear:  
You don’t walk into a restaurant, look at the menu, and ask the server if the prices are negotiable.  
You don’t bring your car to a mechanic and say, *“Actually, I think that brake job should cost 30% less.”*  
So why are skilled professionals — with decades of experience — constantly expected to **justify or bargain** their rate?

🎯 Whether you’re just starting out or have 20+ years in the field, you have **the right to set your rate** based on your experience, your skills, and the value you bring.

And let’s be honest — if you’re charging way above your capability, it’ll become obvious quickly during the interview process.  
But the opposite is also true: if you’re highly skilled and underpricing yourself, you’re not just doing yourself a disservice — you’re undercutting the market and sending the wrong signal.

📢 So to all recruiters and hiring managers out there:  
- If you’ve asked for the resume, read it.  
- If you’ve requested a rate, respect it.  
- And if you want to assess skills, do it in a way that values time and experience, not just keywords.

We’re professionals — not auction items.
